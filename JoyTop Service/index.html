                Have all the required documents. The required documents vary depending on the type of visa you are
                applying for, so be sure to check with the Cambodian embassy or consulate for a list of the required
                documents.
            </p>
            <p>Pay the visa application fee. The visa application fee varies depending on the type of visa you are
                applying for.
            </p>
            <p>Submit your application in person. In most cases, you will need to submit your visa application in person
                at a Cambodian embassy or consulate.
